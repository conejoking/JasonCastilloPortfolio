        <h2>My Story</h2>

            <p>Born and raised in Austin TX with roots deep in the soil of Texas. I have always excelled in math and science, which led me to earn a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering with a concentration in micro and nano devices, along with a minor in applied mathematics and physics.</p>

            <p>This educational background paved the way for my career in semiconductors, and I secured a position as a Photo Equipment Engineer at NXP. My experience as an intern in Etch equipment engineering provided me with the expertise needed to perform well in this new role.</p>
            
            <p>Over the years, my role evolved from being a tool owner for TEL coater tools in DUV and i-Line to becoming more interested in the process engineering side. My fascination with statistics and semiconductor processes led me to transition into a Photo Process Engineer role, where I took ownership of the polyimide layer and i-Line coater processes. During this period, I recognized an opportunity to integrate software into my daily tasks, drawing from various applications I utilized.</p>
            
            <p>To further enhance my skills, I applied to the University of Texas at Austin for their OPTION III Master's program in software engineering and was accepted. Initially, it presented one of the most challenging periods of my life, as I had to build a solid foundation in software, lacking from my previous education, while learning current software engineering practices. Despite setbacks, with improved time management, I overcame challenges and caught up with my classmates. I successfully balanced academics and career responsibilities, passing my classes while achieving strict tool installations at work.</p>
            
            <p>However, due to a reallocation of resources at NXP resulting from fab repurposing, there was a layoff, and unfortunately, my name was drawn. Despite this setback, I remain dedicated to improving as an engineer and eagerly anticipate applying my newfound knowledge once I return to the workforce.</p>
