        <h2>My Story test</h2>

            <p>Born and raised in Austin TX a beautiful landscape and where technology and research thrives. 
            I always excelled in math and science and knew no matter what I did in the future it would be utilizing these skills.
            I went to Austin Community College after high school but without direction dropped out to figure out my calling in life. 
            Once i learned about engineering I knew that what i had to do and worked full time and went school full time. 
            I transfered to Texas State University in San Marcos and recieved my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering 
            with a concentration in micro and nano devices in Dec 2017, along with a minor in applied mathematics and physics.</p>

            <p>This educational background paved the way for my career in semiconductors, and I secured a position as a Photo Equipment Engineer at NXP. 
                My experience as an intern in Etch equipment engineering provided me with the expertise needed to perform well in this new role.
                Over the years, my role evolved from being a tool owner for TEL coater tools in DUV and i-Line to becoming more interested in the process engineering side. My fascination with statistics and semiconductor processes led me to transition into a Photo Process Engineer role, where I took ownership of the polyimide layer and i-Line coater processes. 
                During this period, I recognized an opportunity to integrate software into my daily tasks, drawing from various applications I utilized.</p>
            
            <p>To further enhance this skill need, I applied to the University of Texas at Austin for their OPTION III Master's program in software engineering, which allows working professionals to continue thier education,and was accepted. 
                Initially, it presented one of the most challenging periods of my life, as I had to build a solid foundation in software, lacking from my previous education, while learning current software engineering practices. 
                Despite setbacks, with improved time management, I overcame challenges and caught up with my classmates and made new friends. 
                I successfully balanced academics and career responsibilities, passing my classes while achieving strict tool installations deadlines at work.
                I was able to complete my master program in May 2024 and now an even better engineering because of it.</p>
            
            <p>During my last year in the program I was laid off from my job and had the opportunity to focus school even more while sharpening my skills. 
                I was able to learn some side passions as Unreal Enginer game development and Blender to make animations. 
                While I might not be working for a company at the moment I am an Engineer regardless and continue projects and learning from each one of them.
                Engineering is not a job role to me but a way of life and is something I live for and will continue to be stronger in. 
            </p>
