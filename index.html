        <h2>My Story:</h2>
        <p>
            Hello and welcome to my webpage! I was always good at math and science growing up and that is why I have a bachlor degree in electrical engineering with a concentration in micro and nano devices and a minor of applied mathmatics and physics. 
        This has lead me to pursue a career in semiconductors and I landed a job at NXP Photo equipment engineer. With my work as an intern as a Etch equipment engineer, I was given the expertise to be able to perfrom well in this new position. 
        After years of being a tool owner for TEL coater tools in DUV and then i-Line, I was becoming more drawn to the process engineer side. This was due to my interest in statistics and semiconductor processes and felt like I was finally applying what i learned in school. 
        I became a photo process engineer, where i was a polyimide layer owner and iLine coater process owner. During this time I saw an oppurtunity in integrating software to my everday job from all the different applications I utilized.
        I applied to the University of Texas at Austin for thier OPTION III Master program for software engineering and was accepted. In the beginning it was truly one of my hardest challenges in my life and was forced to build a foundation of software that I didn't have while learning current software engineering pratices. 
        With some setbacks and better time management I was able to overcome and catch back up to my classmates. I was succeeding in my academics and career where I was passing my classes and reaching strict tool install at work. Then NXP had a reallocation of resroures due to a fab repurposing there was a lay off in which my name was drawn. 
        Although I have lost my job I still keep busy in improving as an engineer and looking forward to what i can do once I'm back to work with everything I'm learning
