              <p><strong>GPU Image Blur Using CUDA</strong><br>
                <em>UT Austin &emsp; 2023</em><br>
                Created an implementation of Gaussian Blur and then integrated CUDA. The runtime was compared from the CPU and GPU implementation over different-sized BMP images.

            <p><strong>Bitcoin Punch Clock</strong><br>
                <em>UT Austin &emsp; 2022</em><br>
                Developed a solution for instant payment after a shift by having an employee punch in and out and depending on how long their shift was, the amount they were paid. The system was implemented with an Arduino, Bitcoin test net, and a server.

              <p><strong>HDL Microcontroller</strong><br>
                <em>Texas State University &emsp; 2016</em><br>
                Designed a microcontroller on Xilinx using Verilog HDL. We were the only team that was able to implement a pipeline successfully even though this feature requirement was removed due to difficulty.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Analog and Mixed Signals</strong><br>
                <em>Texas State University &emsp; 2017</em><br>
                Designed analog and mixed-signal circuits, like PLL and other filters. Utilized NI Multisim to run simulations and then implement with real hardware components on a breadboard and testing with Oscilloscope with FFT, DMM, and signal generators.
            </p>  
            <p><strong>pH Meter for Industrial Use</strong><br>
                <em>Texas State University &emsp; 2017</em><br>
                Solution to a pH problem for a concrete facility drainage for a senior design project. Developed an outdoor pH meter that could take pH samples every given time and output its value to a workstation. I programmed a Raspberry Pi that could read the signal and had a calibration function based on a linear equation.

              <p><strong>Defect Classification ML</strong><br>
                <em>NXP &emsp; 2022</em><br>
                With manual classification of defects came an abundance of man hours and delayed test results for crucial fab issues. The solution was to develop an ML model to automatically classify defects from defect images. Utilizing a large data set of already classified defect images, we were able to train a model to provide a proof of concept that could help reduce cost and defectivity to the company.

              <p><strong>Dry Etch RF Match Qualification</strong><br>
                <em>NXP &emsp; 2017</em><br>
                Due to large RF match failures and no more support, there was a need for a more robust option. I qualified an RF match with vacuum capacitors for a dry etch tool by installing the hardware and running process qualification that yielded a 20% increase in efficiency.

            <em>Personal &emsp; 2016 - present</em><br>
            First starting video game development on an iPhone using Xcode with the Swift language to make a side-scrolling plane shooter game. Then recently started learning Unreal Engine to develop 3D games. Alongside that, I'm also rendering computer graphics using Blender.
